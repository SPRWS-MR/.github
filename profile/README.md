Unofficial repo used to centralize automation and GIS scripting for the Engineering/Maps & Records groups. 

If you want to create you own repo let me know. Otherwise by default everything in the org is read-only.

Demo showing how to manage commits/pushes from VSCode, and how to automate setting things up easily to come.
